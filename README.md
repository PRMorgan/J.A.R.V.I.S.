# J.A.R.V.I.S.
A simple recreation of the J.A.R.V.I.S. system from the Iron man comics and movies.

I wanted to create an overly complex alarm clock based on J.A.R.V.I.S. This alarm clock has you enter the name of your city and the time you want to wake up. J.A.R.V.I.S. will then wait for the time you entered, checking every 10 seconds. Once your set time arrives, J.A.R.V.I.S. will read out the time and current weather conditions.
